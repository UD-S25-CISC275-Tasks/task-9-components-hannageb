 * Each die’s value should be rendered in the View in a span tag of their own, with the first dice having the data-testid of left-die and the second dice having the data-testid of right-die.
 * You will need two “Roll” buttons (labelled Roll Left and Roll Right).
 * Clicking a Roll button will change the value for the corresponding dice using the provided d6 function.
 * The initial values of the dice cannot be the same.
 * When the two states are equal but ARE both ones, render a message that includes the word Lose.
 * When the two states are equal but are NOT both ones, render a message that includes the word Win.
 * If you do all these and are still not passing all tests, read the test file, it is a good practice! In much of software engineering, the tests are the product spec.
